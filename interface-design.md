Game of Chores

Parent/Admin Interface

Goal: Easy and intuitive creation of practical tasks. 

Limitations: Only single task types for now. Create one, complete one. Combos and grouped tasks come later.

Chore Creation
The object of the chore creation is to allow the parent to create a measurable practical task for the child to accomplish within a given time frame. For this, the following options need to be available to the parent:
- Chore name
- Chore type (adds an icon to better explain the nature of the chore (washing, cleaning, homework, clothing etc.)
- Chore description (Select from pre-defined texts, or type in own).
- Chore deadline (time at which the chore will 'fail' unless child has submitted a 'completed' report).
- Chore repetition(weekdays, weekends, single days, every other day etc.)
- Child selection (same chore can be added to more than one child). All chores created are added to a general set available to the parent to distribute to any child.
- Add counter to Chores per child to see how many Chores a child has per day/per week. Also add in some functionality for checking amount of chores assigned to any one child and report back to parent about the 'load' on the child relative to his/her age.

User Creation
This tool is used to create a new member of the family that chores can be added to. Name and age are the most relevant attributes needed for this.

User Tracking
Split into Parental Tracking and Child Tracking. Both users can track chores individually, but the Parental section has overview of all children, while the child section only shows tracking for the inidividual themselves. Parental tracking has tools for approval of chore completion, and also the ability to assign exceptions to the chore. Exceptions are used when the child is unable to perform the chore for practical reasons (being away from home).

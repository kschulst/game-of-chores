Game of Chores

Game master/Admin Interface

Goal: Easy and intuitive creation of practical tasks. 

Limitations: Only single task types for now. Create one, complete one. Combos and grouped tasks come later.

Chore Creation
The object of the chore creation is to allow the game master to create a measurable practical task for the player to accomplish within a given time frame. For this, the following options need to be available to the game master:
- Chore name
- Chore type (adds an icon to better explain the nature of the chore (washing, cleaning, homework, clothing etc.)
- Chore description (Select from pre-defined texts, or type in own).
- Chore deadline (time at which the chore will 'fail' unless player has submitted a 'completed' report).
- Chore repetition(weekdays, weekends, single days, every other day etc.)
- Player selection (same chore can be added to more than one player). All chores created are added to a general set available to the game master to distribute to any player.
- Add counter to Chores per player to see how many Chores a player has per day/per week. Also add in some functionality for checking amount of chores assigned to any one player and report back to game master about the 'load' on the player relative to his/her age.

User Creation
This tool is used to create a new member of the family that chores can be added to. Name and age are the most relevant attributes needed for this.

User Tracking
Split into game master Tracking and player Tracking. Both users can track chores individually, but the game master section has overview of all players, while the player section only shows tracking for the inidividual themselves. game master tracking has tools for approval of chore completion, and also the ability to assign exceptions to the chore. Exceptions are used when the player is unable to perform the chore for practical reasons (being away from home).
